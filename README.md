# Password-Generator- 
Focusing on JavaScript I have created an application that will generate a random password. The password is generated by critera that is selected from the user. The application is web based and will run in the browser, the pages are dynamic, and the interface is responsive. The HTML and CSS are powered by JavaScript. The password is between 8 and 128 characters including lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. Prompts and alerts were a huge factor in this project.
